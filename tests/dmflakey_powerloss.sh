# dm-flakey power-loss crash test for vaultis.
# =============================================
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The in-tree crash tests (`tests/crash_recovery.rs`) abort the process with
# `std::process::abort()` (SIGKILL-class). That models the PROCESS dying, but the OS
# still flushes its page cache afterward — so a *missing or wrong `fsync`* is invisible
# to those tests (and to mutation testing: an `fsync` removed by a mutant changes no
# in-process behaviour). The ONLY way to verify the fsync/ordering is genuinely correct
# is to simulate a real power loss where **un-fsync'd writes never reach the platter**.
#
# This harness does exactly that, using Linux device-mapper `dm-flakey`:
#   1. vaultis's vault lives on an ext4 fs on a dm-flakey device.
#   2. A workload runs with the device in normal pass-through mode (its `fsync`s reach
#      the backing store; un-fsync'd writes sit in the page cache).
#   3. "Power loss": the device is reloaded with the `drop_writes` feature and the fs is
#      unmounted — the unmount flushes the page cache, but the device DISCARDS those
#      writes. Result: the on-disk state contains only what vaultis actually fsync'd.
#   4. The device is restored to normal, the fs remounted, and the vault is reopened.
#      It MUST still open and the committed document MUST still be intact. If vaultis
#      were missing an fsync, that data would be gone here and `verify` would fail.
#
# It also crashes mid-operation at each named commit point (`PMVAULT_CRASH_AT`, the
# same labels the in-tree tests use) so the power loss lands at a precise commit step.
#
# REQUIREMENTS
# ------------
#   * Linux, run as ROOT (it uses losetup / dmsetup / mount / mkfs.ext4).
#   * A nightly-or-stable cargo toolchain (only to build the test binary).
#   * Tools: dmsetup, losetup, mkfs.ext4, mount, umount, blockdev.
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   sudo tests/dmflakey_powerloss.sh
#
# Optional env vars:
#   VAULTIS_BIN=/path/to/vaultis   use a prebuilt binary (must be built with
#                                   `--features fault-injection`; default: build it)
#   BACKING_DIR=/var/tmp            where the backing image lives (real storage is best;
#                                   it is the simulated "disk")
#   KEEP=1                          don't tear down the dm/loop devices on exit (debug)
#
# SAFETY: everything is created under unique names and removed by the EXIT trap; it
# never touches your real vault or any existing block device.
