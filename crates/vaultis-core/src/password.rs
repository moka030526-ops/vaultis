//! Built-in password generator.
//!
//! Uses the OS CSPRNG (via [`crate::crypto::random_bytes`]) with rejection
//! sampling so character selection has no modulo bias. When the requested
//! length allows, at least one character from every enabled class is
//! guaranteed, then the result is shuffled.
//!
//! Rust orientation for non-Rust readers:
//! - `//!` lines are *module-level* documentation (they describe this whole
//!   file); `///` documents the item that immediately follows it; `//` is an
//!   ordinary inline comment.
//! - A "CSPRNG" is a cryptographically secure random number generator.
//! - "Rejection sampling" / "modulo bias": naively doing `random % n` makes
//!   some indices slightly more likely than others. We discard out-of-range
//!   draws instead so every index is equally likely (see `uniform` below).

// `use` brings names into scope (like an import). The `{a, b}` form imports
// two items from the same module: `random_bytes` (a function) and `CryptoError`
// (an error type) from this crate's `crypto` module. `crate::` means "rooted at
// this project", not an external dependency.
