//! The encrypted vault file and the orchestration over the partitioned document
//! store ([`crate::storage`]).
//!
//! The user supplies a **directory** `mypath`; inside it:
//! ```text
//!   mypath/vault.pmv          encrypted JSON vault (header + AEAD ciphertext)
//!   mypath/manifest/manifest.<N>   encrypted per-partition document index
//!   mypath/volume/vol.<N>          append-only, per-blob-encrypted documents
//! ```
//! `OpenVault` is given the vault *file* path (`mypath/vault.pmv`) and derives the
//! directory as its parent; the [`VolumeStore`] lives under that directory.
//!
//! Vault file layout (all integers little-endian):
//! ```text
//!   0   8   magic  b"PMVAULT\0"
//!   8   1   format version (currently 4)
//!   9   4   Argon2 m_cost (KiB)
//!   13  4   Argon2 t_cost
//!   17  4   Argon2 p_cost
//!   21  16  salt1
//!   37  24  nonce (XChaCha20-Poly1305)
//!   61  ..  ciphertext of the JSON vault
//! ```
//! The **entire 61-byte header** (incl. the nonce) is the AEAD associated data, so
//! tampering with the version/params/salt/nonce fails the Poly1305 tag on decrypt.
//!
//! Crash-safety: the document store commits per-operation (see [`crate::storage`]);
//! the vault file is the **final** commit point. A password change re-encrypts the
//! whole tree under a fresh key via a staged-and-rolled-forward protocol so a crash
//! mid-rotation always leaves either the old or the new tree fully working.
