//! Cryptographic core for vaultis.
//!
//! Design:
//! - Master password -> 32-byte key via **Argon2id** (memory-hard KDF) with a
//!   random per-vault salt. KDF parameters are stored in the vault header so the
//!   file stays self-describing and we can raise the cost over time.
//! - Vault bytes are encrypted with **XChaCha20-Poly1305** (AEAD). The 24-byte
//!   nonce is random per write; the **entire vault header — magic, version,
//!   Argon2 parameters, salt, AND the nonce — is fed in as associated data**, so
//!   any tampering with it (a cost-parameter downgrade, a swapped salt, a flipped
//!   nonce) is detected by the Poly1305 tag on decrypt. To make that possible the
//!   nonce is generated first and authenticated via [`encrypt_with_nonce`].
//! - The derived [`Key`] zeroizes its bytes on drop.
//!
//! Rust-reader orientation (this file assumes you may not know Rust):
//! - `//!` at the top of a file is a *module-level doc comment* describing the
//!   whole module; `///` documents the item immediately below it; `//` is an
//!   ordinary inline comment. None of these affect runtime behavior.
//! - Functions return `Result<T, E>` (either an `Ok(T)` value or an `Err(E)`).
//!   The `?` operator after such a call means "if it's an error, stop and
//!   return that error from this function; otherwise unwrap the success value."
//! - `&[u8]` is a *borrowed* read-only view of a byte buffer (a "slice"); the
//!   caller still owns the data, we just look at it. `&` = shared/borrowed.
//! - Secret material is wiped from memory when it goes out of scope (`zeroize`),
//!   which is why several types and locals exist purely to control cleanup.

// `use` brings names from other crates (libraries) into scope, like imports.
