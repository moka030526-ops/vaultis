//! Cross-PROCESS single-writer lock test.
//!
//! The core's `single_writer_lock_blocks_second_writable_open` takes the second lock via
//! a different fd in ONE process, but `fs::File::try_lock` is per-open-file-description,
//! so genuine inter-process semantics can differ from same-process behaviour. Here a REAL
//! second process holds the writable lock (via the hidden `__holdlock` subcommand) while
//! this process asserts that a writable open fails fast with `Locked`, a read-only open
//! still succeeds, and the lock is released when that process exits. A corrupted vault
//! from a missed cross-process lock would be catastrophic, so prove the real threat model.
//!
//! Compiled only with the `fault-injection` feature (which builds `__holdlock` into the
//! spawned binary), alongside the other subprocess tests:
//!     cargo test -p vaultis --features vaultis/fault-injection --test lock_cross_process
