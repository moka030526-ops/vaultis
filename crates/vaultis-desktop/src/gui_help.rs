//! The graphical app's built-in manual.
//!
//! This module holds the *content* of the in-app help (a table of topics, each a
//! list of typed blocks) plus the code that renders it as a two-pane browser:
//! a searchable topic index on the left, the selected article on the right.
//!
//! The content is deliberately kept as plain data (`TOPICS`) rather than inline
//! `ui.label(...)` calls so that:
//! - the search box can match against every word of every article without the
//!   article having to be rendered first ([`search`] is a pure function),
//! - a test can assert structural invariants (unique ids, no empty articles),
//! - re-ordering or re-wording the manual never touches rendering code.
//!
//! Nothing here reads or writes the vault: the manual is static text plus the
//! three on-disk paths handed in via [`HelpContext`].
