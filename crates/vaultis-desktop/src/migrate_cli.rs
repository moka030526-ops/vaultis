//! THROWAWAY: the `migrate-doc-paths` CLI subcommand — a one-shot conversion of an existing
//! vault to the owner-first / timestamp-in-filename document path scheme, which also deletes
//! history and compacts the volume to shrink the vault.
//!
//! To remove the feature: delete this file, the `mod migrate_cli;` line + dispatch arm in
//! `main.rs`, its HELP stanza, and (in the core crate) `src/vault/migrate.rs` + its
//! `pub mod migrate;` line. It reuses existing helpers only (no permanent surface added).
