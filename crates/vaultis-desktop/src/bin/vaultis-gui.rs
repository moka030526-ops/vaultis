//! Windowed launcher for the graphical UI.
//!
//! This is the same as `vaultis [DIR] [--write]`, but built as a Windows
//! **GUI-subsystem** executable. A normal Rust binary uses the *console* subsystem,
//! so when Windows launches it from Explorer or a shortcut it first allocates a
//! command window and *then* the GUI opens on top — the "two windows" you'd
//! otherwise see. Marking this binary `windows_subsystem = "windows"` tells the
//! linker it is a GUI app, so no console window is ever created.
//!
//! The console `vaultis` binary is unchanged and remains the home for the CLI
//! subcommands and the `--tui` terminal UI — those genuinely need a console, which
//! is exactly what a GUI-subsystem app does not have. (Mirrors the classic
//! `python.exe` vs `pythonw.exe` split.) The attribute is inert on non-Windows
//! targets, so this binary is just "the GUI" everywhere else.
