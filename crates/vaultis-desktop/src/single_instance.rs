//! Single-instance guard for the graphical app.
//!
//! The GUI opens its window *immediately* (before the vault is even unlocked),
//! and nothing in the binary used to detect an already-running instance — so
//! launching vaultis repeatedly (a double-clicked launcher, a dock icon, a
//! script) stacked a separate window per launch, which the user then had to close
//! one by one. This module coalesces launches for the **same vault** into a single
//! window:
//!
//! - The first launch for a vault becomes the **primary**: it takes an OS
//!   advisory lock on a per-vault lock file (kernel-released on exit/crash, so it
//!   never goes stale — the same mechanism the vault's single-writer lock uses)
//!   and, on Unix, binds a tiny local socket.
//! - A later launch for the same vault finds the lock held → it is a
//!   **secondary**: on Unix it pings the primary's socket to raise its window,
//!   then exits without opening a second window. On other platforms it simply
//!   exits (still no pile-up, just no raise-to-front).
//!
//! Keyed on the *canonical vault path*, so two different vaults still get two
//! windows. The lock/socket live in the per-user runtime (or cache) directory and
//! carry **no vault data** — the socket only ever transports a "raise your window"
//! nudge (the connection itself is the signal; no bytes are trusted).
//!
//! The guard must never stop the app from running: any I/O problem setting it up
//! degrades to "run as an unguarded primary" (see [`acquire`]). Power users who
//! deliberately want several windows for one vault can set
//! `PMVAULT_ALLOW_MULTIPLE=1` to bypass the guard entirely.
//!
//! (Rust note: `#[cfg(unix)]` compiles an item only on Unix-like targets; the
//! `#[cfg(not(unix))]` twin provides a no-op fallback so the crate still builds
//! everywhere. A field/binding named with a leading `_` is intentionally unused —
//! here `InstanceGuard._lock` exists only so its `Drop` releases the lock.)
