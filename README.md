# vaultis — your private, offline estate vault

vaultis is a small program that keeps your important life and estate information
in **one safe, locked place on your own computer**: account logins, where your
money and property are, your will and trust details, and scans of important
documents. It is locked with **two passwords**, everything is strongly encrypted,
and **it never connects to the internet** — nothing is uploaded, synced, or
shared anywhere.

This is especially useful for estate planning: you can keep everything your
family or executor would need in one organized, protected file.

---

## ⚠️ Please read this first — the 3 things that matter most

1. **You choose two passwords. You need BOTH to open the vault.** Enter them in
   the same order every time.
2. **There is no "forgot password" and no back door. If you lose both passwords,
   the information is gone forever** — by design, so nobody else can get in
   either. Write the two passwords down and keep them somewhere safe (and
   consider leaving them with a trusted person or in a sealed envelope for your
   executor).
3. **Keep a backup.** The vault is a file on your computer. If the computer is
   lost, stolen, or breaks, you lose the vault unless you have a backup copy. The
   program has a one-click **Backup** button — use it regularly and keep a copy on
   a separate drive (see "Making a backup" below).

---

# Part 1 — Using vaultis (no technical knowledge needed)

These steps assume the program is already installed on your computer. If it
isn't, see **Part 2** (or ask whoever set it up for you).

## Starting the program

- **Windows:** double-click **`vaultis-gui.exe`**. A window opens, with no
  command/console window alongside it. (There is also a `vaultis.exe` — that one is
  the command-line version and *does* show a console; it's only for the advanced
  commands further down. For everyday use, always launch `vaultis-gui.exe`.)
- **Mac/Linux:** double-click the **`vaultis-gui`** program (or `vaultis`), or open
  it the way the person who set it up showed you.

When it opens it is in **View-only mode** (a 🔒 READ-ONLY badge shows at the
bottom). You can look at everything but not change anything. This is a safety
feature so you can browse without accidentally editing. To make changes, you use
the **Edit shortcut** described next.

## Turning on editing (one-time setup)

To **create** a vault or **change** anything, the program must be started in
**Edit mode**. The easiest way is to make an "Edit" shortcut once:

**On Windows:**
1. Right-click **`vaultis-gui.exe`** → **Show more options** → **Create shortcut**.
   (Use `vaultis-gui.exe`, not `vaultis.exe`, so edit mode also opens with no
   console window.)
2. Right-click the new shortcut → **Properties**.
3. In the **Target** box, go to the very end, add a space, then type `--write`.
   It should end with `...\vaultis-gui.exe --write`.
4. Click **OK**. Rename the shortcut to **"vaultis (Edit)"**.

Now: **double-click "vaultis (Edit)" when you want to add or change things**, and
the plain program when you only want to look.

> The everyday program stays view-only on purpose. Keep the Edit shortcut for
> when you actually need to make changes.

> **Ready-made shortcuts with icons.** The [`packaging/`](packaging/) folder has
> both shortcuts done for you — **vaultis (View)** with a **locked-vault** icon and
> **vaultis (Edit)** with an **unlocked-vault** icon. On Linux run
> `packaging/linux/install-shortcuts.sh`; on Windows run
> `packaging\windows\make-shortcuts.ps1`. See [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md).

## Creating your vault the first time (step by step)

1. Start the program using the **Edit** shortcut (above).
2. Because there is no vault yet, you'll see a **Create** screen.
3. Type your **first password**, then type it again to confirm.
4. Type your **second password**, then type it again to confirm.
5. Click **Create**. Your vault is made and opens, ready to fill in.

Choose passwords that are long and memorable to you but hard for others to guess.
**Write both down and store them safely now.**

## Opening your vault later

1. Start the program (Edit shortcut if you want to change things; plain program to
   just look).
2. The start page shows a **Vault root** box and a **Vault** box with a dropdown.
   Point the **root** at the folder that holds your vaults (handy if you keep them on a
   USB stick or in a synced folder): the app scans the root **one level deep** and the
   dropdown lists every sub-folder that contains a vault. **Pick one** from the dropdown
   (it fills the Vault box and arms it for unlocking), or **type a new folder name** in
   the Vault box to make a brand-new vault there. The chosen **root is remembered** for
   next time (saved in a small local settings file, never inside a vault). If the root
   can't be read, or some sub-folders are inaccessible, a short notice says so. The line
   below shows the exact vault that will open, and whether it already exists (**Unlock**)
   or will be created (**Create**). If you **start the program from a folder that already
   holds vaults** (a terminal launch, or a shortcut whose "start in" folder is set to it),
   that folder is used as the root automatically — no need to have remembered it.
3. Type your **first password**, then your **second password**, in the same order
   as when you created the vault.
4. Click **Unlock**. You'll briefly see when the vault was last opened.

If a password is wrong it simply says so — try again, checking the order.

**Starting a brand-new vault in a folder of your choice:** open the program in
**Edit** mode, set the **Vault root** to where you keep vaults, and **type a new folder
name** in the **Vault** box (one that isn't already in the dropdown). Since no vault
exists there yet, the button changes to **Create vault**; choose your two passwords and
create it — the folder is made for you under the root. (In the plain read-only program
you can *pick* any existing vault to view it, but you can't create one — relaunch in
Edit mode for that.)

**Pasting a folder path:** every box in the program that takes a location on your disk
— the **Vault root** here, plus **Upload from**, the **export directory**, the **backup
destination**, and the **other vault's folder** — accepts a path pasted straight from
your file manager, **including the surrounding double quotes** that Windows Explorer's
"Copy as path" adds (`"C:\Users\me\My Vaults"`). The quotes are stripped for you and the
clean path is what gets remembered. A single stray quote at one end is *kept*, because
that is a legal character in a file name.

## The eight sections (tabs)

Across the top are nine tabs (URGENT first, then the eight below). Click a tab to
switch. The strip **wraps onto another line** if the window is too narrow to fit it on
one — it never scrolls sideways and never hides a tab, so every tab stays clickable at
any window size.

1. **Instructions** — notes and instructions for your family/executor (funeral
   wishes, who to contact, where to find things).
2. **Trust and Will** — your will and trust details, and where the originals are.
3. **Assets and Liabilities** — what you own and what you owe (accounts,
   property, vehicles, loans), with values, owners, and beneficiaries.
4. **Accounts** — logins: banks, email, utilities, subscriptions, etc., with a
   **title**, usernames, and passwords. You can filter the list by title, type,
   subtype, or owner, and **search** in the highlighted 🔍 box (see "Finding an entry
   with the search box" below). The filters **narrow each other**:
   pick a type and the other dropdowns only show values that exist for that type
   (and so on for any combination); a choice that no longer fits is cleared
   automatically. Clicking **New** while a filter is active pre-fills the matching
   fields on the new entry, and when you save, an active filter follows the entry so
   it stays in view (nothing is saved until you click Save). A **reveal** checkbox on
   the Accounts screen shows every account password at once.
5. **Real Estate** — properties: address, ownership, taxes, financing (account +
   balance), and per-property **portal logins** (property management, insurance,
   HOA — each with URL, username, password). Each property can also hold uploaded
   **documents** (deed, insurance policy, statements).
6. **Taxes** — one entry per **filing year**, holding that year's tax documents
   (W-2s, 1099s, the return, receipts). Each entry can hold **several** uploaded
   documents, all kept together in that year's own folder inside the vault.
7. **General Documents** — anything else worth keeping: a title, a description,
   and **one uploaded file** per entry (passport scan, birth certificate, a
   contract). Use one entry per document.
8. **Summary** — a **read-only** overview table: each owner's totals across assets
   and liabilities. It has no records of its own — it aggregates the **Assets and
   Liabilities** entries by owner.

## Adding or changing an entry (step by step)

1. Make sure you're in **Edit mode** (no 🔒 badge).
2. Click the tab you want.
3. Click **➕ New** to add a new entry (or click an existing entry to change it).
4. Fill in the boxes. Move between boxes by clicking them.
5. Click **Save**. A dated note is kept each time you change something, so you
   always have a history.

To remove an entry, select it and click **Delete**.

## Finding an entry with the search box

On the **Accounts** tab, the filter row has a **highlighted 🔍 search box**. Type in it
and the list narrows as you type — there is no button to press. While it is filtering,
the box is tinted, its outline thickens, and a **×** appears inside it to clear the
query (the **Clear** button resets the search *and* every filter).

What it matches:

- The account's **username or title** — a hit in either keeps the entry.
- **Anywhere in the value**, not just the beginning: `elit` finds "Fidelity", `heck`
  finds "Checking".
- **Case doesn't matter**: `alice`, `Alice`, and `ALICE` are the same search.
- **Names that sound like what you typed**: `jonson` finds *Johnson*, `catherine` finds
  *Katherine*, `smith` finds *Smyth*. Words inside an email address are heard
  separately, so `smith` also finds `alice.smyth@example.com`.
- **Several words narrow** rather than widen: every word you type must match, so
  `catherine smith` finds *Katherine Smyth* but not *Katherine Jones*.

Sound-alike matching applies only to words of **three letters or more**, and never to
numbers — so `u2` finds only `u2` (not `u1`), and `2024` must appear literally. Because
the matching is deliberately forgiving, it can offer an entry you weren't looking for;
add more letters, or combine it with the exact type/owner dropdowns.

**Linking an account to an asset.** On **Assets and Liabilities**, the "➕ Link an
account…" dropdown opens with **the same search box already focused** — just start
typing and the list narrows to the matching accounts, scrolling the best match into
view. Only accounts not already linked to that asset are offered, and the search is
forgotten when the popup closes.

The terminal version has the same account search: press <kbd>/</kbd> to type a query,
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to keep it, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to clear it.

## Attaching a document (a will, a statement, a deed)

You can store scanned documents (PDFs, images) **inside** the vault, encrypted
along with everything else.

1. In **Edit mode**, open a **Trust and Will**, **Assets and Liabilities**, or
   **General Documents** entry (these hold one document each).
2. Optionally type a **Subfolder** to organize the file, optionally set a **Filename**
   to save it as, then put the file's path in **Upload from** and click **Upload /
   Attach**. *If you leave the Filename blank, the uploaded file keeps its own name.*
   You can paste the path straight from your file manager — **quotes included** (see
   "Pasting a folder path" above). It must be the path to a *file*, and `~` or
   `%USERPROFILE%` are not expanded, so give the full path.
3. Save. The document is now encrypted inside your vault.

**Getting documents back out (Export).** First set an **Export destination** folder
once, in the **Config** screen. After that, the **Export** button on any document
writes a decrypted copy into that folder, automatically recreating the same folder
layout it had inside the vault — you're never asked for a path. (Exports never
overwrite: a repeat export gets a `_1`, `_2`, … suffix.) The export folder is a
setting on *your computer*, so it can be set and used even when the vault is opened
**read-only** — handy for a family member extracting documents.

On the **Taxes** and **Real Estate** tabs it works the same way, but each entry can
hold **several** documents: open (or create) the entry, then upload as many files as
you like. Use **Export** or **Remove** on any individual document (by its number).

**How files are organized inside the vault.** Every uploaded document is filed under
`<tab>/<entry>/<timestamp>/[your subfolder]/<your filename>` — e.g. a 2024 tax W-2
lands in `taxes/2024/<when-you-uploaded-it>/[subfolder]/W-2.pdf`. The tab and entry
(filing year, property address, document title, …) are filled in for you; you choose
only the optional subfolder and the filename.

## Showing or copying a password

- On the **Accounts** (and **Real Estate**) tab, use the single **reveal all**
  checkbox to show the hidden passwords. It's a momentary switch — it turns itself
  off when you leave the tab, so passwords don't stay visible by accident.
- Use **Copy** to copy a password so you can paste it elsewhere. For your safety
  the program **automatically clears the clipboard 15 seconds later** (and when
  you close the program), so a copied password doesn't linger.

## Changing the colors (theme)

Open the **Config** screen and pick a **Color theme** — ten palettes: Light, Dark,
High contrast, Solarized, Sepia, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox Dark, Gruvbox Light, and Rosé
Pine. The change applies immediately and is remembered for next time. It's only a
display preference — it changes nothing about your data.

## Getting help inside the program

Click **❓ Help** in the top bar for a built-in, sectioned guide (this README in
short form) plus the exact locations of your vault and the small preferences file on
this computer.

## Making a backup (please do this regularly)

1. In **Edit mode**, open the **Config** screen.
2. Find **Backup** — its destination is pre-filled with your **vault root** (the folder
   that holds your vaults); change it to wherever you want (for example a USB drive),
   then click **Backup now**.
3. The program saves a dated, still-encrypted copy of your vault and its
   documents. Keep at least one backup on a **separate** drive or location.

Backups are still encrypted — each one needs the **two passwords that were in effect
when it was made** (see the next section about changing passwords).

## Updating from another vault

If you keep a second copy of your estate vault somewhere — a spouse's machine, a USB
stick, a synced folder — you can pull the newer entries from it into this one without
re-typing anything. It is **one-way and additive**: it brings in records that are
**newer** (or entirely new) in the other vault, along with the documents they reference,
and it **never deletes** anything from your current vault.

1. In **Edit mode**, open **Config** and click **“Update from another vault…”** (in the
   terminal UI, press **Ctrl+U** on the Config screen).
2. Enter the **other vault's folder** and its **two passwords**. (The other vault is only
   ever read — it is opened read-only.)
3. You'll see a **preview**: exactly which records would change (new vs updated, with their
   dates) and which documents would be copied. Nothing has changed yet.
4. Click **Apply** to make those changes, or **Cancel** to back out.

Notes:
- "Newer" is decided by each record's last-edit time. If a record is newer **here**, it is
  left alone; the update only ever moves *forward*.
- Deletions are **not** carried over — if you deleted something here, an update won't bring
  it back (a record that depends on a document you deleted is simply skipped, and the
  preview says so).
- It's wise to **back up first** (the update overwrites the matching records here).
- From the command line: `vaultis update-from OTHER [DIR]` (add `--dry-run` to preview
  only). It asks for four passwords in order: **this** vault's two, then the **other**
  vault's two.

## Changing your master passwords

Use the **🔑 Passwords** button (Edit mode) — or `p` in the terminal UI — to set two
new passwords. The program fully re-encrypts your vault under the new passwords.

**Important — this does NOT change your old backups.** A backup is a separate copy,
so changing your passwords only re-encrypts the vault on this computer; any backup you
made earlier still opens with the **old** passwords (and a new backup opens with the
new ones). So after changing your passwords:

- **Make a fresh backup** right away, so you have a recoverable copy under the new
  passwords. (Changing passwords does not auto-backup; only *Compact* does.)
- **If you changed because the old passwords may have been seen by someone else,**
  remember that your **old backups are still readable with those old passwords** —
  securely delete the old backups (or keep them only if you trust where they are).
- To restore an old backup, open it with the passwords it was made under; it will be
  an older copy (anything you changed since is not in it).

## If something goes wrong (power loss, crash, disk full)

vaultis is built so that a power cut, a forced shutdown, or a full disk **cannot
corrupt your vault**. Whatever you were doing either fully completed or did not
happen at all — there is never a half-saved, broken state. In almost every case the
fix is the same: **just open the vault again.** It repairs itself automatically when
it opens. (This is about *interruptions*. The rarer case of the file being
physically *damaged* — a failing drive, a bad copy — is covered in the next
section.)

What to expect after an interruption, by what you were doing at the time:

- **Adding, editing, or deleting an entry, or uploading a document.** If the
  interruption happened before it finished, that one change simply didn't take —
  reopen and do it again. Everything else is exactly as it was. A full disk shows an
  error and changes nothing; free up space and try again.
- **Changing your master passwords.** Open the vault again and try the **new**
  passwords first; if those don't work, the change didn't complete, so use the
  **old** passwords. One of the two always works — an interruption can never lock you
  out. (Opening the vault quietly finishes, or cancels, a half-done change.)
- **Compacting (reclaiming space / trimming history — see Part 2).** Same as a
  password change: reopen and you'll have either the old vault or the compacted one,
  never a mix. Compacting also makes a dated backup **before** it starts (unless you
  turned that off), so the pre-compaction state is saved either way.
- **Making a backup, exporting, or extracting documents.** These only ever *read*
  your vault, so it is never at risk. If one was interrupted you may find a
  half-written copy in the destination folder — just delete that partial copy and
  run it again.

**Two rules:**

1. **Always safe to reopen.** After any crash, just start vaultis again — recovery
   is automatic; there is nothing manual to run.
2. **Never hand-edit the vault folder.** Don't move, rename, or delete the files
   inside it (`vault.pmv`, the `manifest/` and `volume/` folders, a temporary
   `.rekey/` folder, or `vaultis.lock`). They are a matched set — let the program
   manage them. If it ever reports the vault is "locked" after a hard crash, make
   sure no other vaultis window is open and try again; the lock releases itself when
   the program exits.

## If the vault file itself is damaged (a failing disk or a bad copy)

The protections above are about *interruptions*. A separate, rarer problem is the
file being physically **damaged** — for example a failing hard drive or USB stick,
bit-rot on old storage, or a copy that didn't finish. vaultis handles this safely
too:

- **It never shows you wrong information.** Every part of the vault is sealed with a
  cryptographic check. If anything has been altered or damaged, vaultis reports an
  error and refuses to open, rather than showing you scrambled or incorrect data.
  (The very same "can't open" message also appears if you simply mistype a password,
  so first just **re-check both passwords**, in order.)
- **Small damage often repairs itself.** The internal index of your documents can be
  rebuilt automatically from the documents themselves, so losing or damaging that
  index is not fatal — just reopen.
- **One damaged document doesn't block the rest.** If a single stored document is
  damaged, the vault still opens and everything else works normally; only that one
  document shows an error when you try to open it.
- **If the main vault file is damaged, restore your backup.** The main file keeps no
  built-in spare copy — *that is what your backups are for.* Open your most recent
  backup with the same two passwords. (This is exactly why the first thing this guide
  asks is to keep regular backups on a separate drive.)

If even a backup won't open, you can still rescue individual documents from any copy
that *does* open, using **Export** on each entry that has one (or the `extract`
command in Part 2).

## If you are a family member or executor

If someone left you this vault:

1. You need **both passwords**, in order. They should have been written down and
   stored for you.
2. Open the plain program (view-only is fine for reading) and enter the two
   passwords.
3. Browse the tabs — start with **Instructions** and **Trust and Will**.
4. To save copies of stored documents to the computer, use **Export** on each
   entry that has one.

## Where your information is stored

Everything lives in a single locked file on the computer:

| Your system | Where the vault file is |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\vaultis\vault.pmv` |
| Mac/Linux | `~/.local/share/vaultis/vault.pmv` |

Your uploaded documents are stored right next to it, inside `manifest/` and
`volume/` folders in the same `vaultis` directory. Everything is encrypted and
useless to anyone without your two passwords — so treat the **whole folder** as one
unit: back it up together, and don't move or delete pieces of it. Keep it — and your
backups — safe.

Two small **preferences** (your chosen color theme and your export-destination
folder) are kept separately, in a tiny **non-secret** `prefs.json` — it holds no vault
data, so it's fine if it's lost:

| Your system | Where `prefs.json` is |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\vaultis\vaultis\config\prefs.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/dev.vaultis.vaultis/prefs.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/vaultis/prefs.json` |

(The **❓ Help** screen shows the exact paths for your machine.)

# Part 2 — For the person who sets it up (technical)

## Getting the program (build from source)

vaultis is written in Rust. Install the toolchain from <https://rustup.rs> if you
don't have it, then build:

### Linux

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/vaultis-gui         # graphical window
./target/release/vaultis --tui       # terminal version (works over SSH)
./target/release/vaultis decrypt …   # command-line tools (see "advanced" below)
```

#### Build **and** get a demo vault to click around in

```bash
scripts/build.sh              # debug build   (add --release for the optimized one)
```

(On Windows, use `scripts\build.bat` — same flags, same output.)

Same build, plus it creates a **fully populated sample vault** — every tab filled in,
with attached documents — and prints, as the last thing after the build output, where
it is and the two passwords that open it:

```
  Location:    <repo>/target/sample-vault
  Password 1:  sample1
  Password 2:  sample2
```

Everything in that vault is fiction, and its two passwords are deliberately trivial
because it is a throwaway demo — never put anything real in it. Re-running the script
leaves an existing sample vault untouched (so edits you made while exploring survive);
`--fresh` rebuilds it, `--sample-dir DIR` puts it somewhere else, and `--no-sample`
skips it entirely.

The build produces **two programs**: `vaultis-gui` (the graphical app) and
`vaultis` (the command-line/terminal version). On Linux/Mac they behave the same
way; the split matters on Windows (next), where the GUI build avoids popping a
console window.

These default Linux builds are **not** fully standalone files: the graphical app
loads your desktop's OpenGL/X11/Wayland libraries at runtime. You can still hand
someone just the binary and it runs **on a normal desktop of the same OS + CPU**
(it borrows the system's own libraries — you don't ship any). For a build you can
drop on *any* Linux box with nothing installed, see the next section.

#### A single, fully self-contained Linux file (static, terminal-only)

The terminal/CLI program can be built as **one statically-linked file with zero
external dependencies** — no shared libraries, no glibc, nothing to install — using
the musl target with the GUI/clipboard features turned off:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl                 # one-time
cargo build --release -p vaultis --bin vaultis \
  --no-default-features --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# -> target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/vaultis  (~2 MB, fully static)

ldd target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/vaultis       # => "statically linked"
```

Copy that one file to any x86-64 Linux machine and run `vaultis --tui` (or the CLI
subcommands) — it needs no libraries at all. The trade-offs of this minimal build:
**no graphical window** (terminal UI only) and **no OS-clipboard copy** (the on-screen
copy becomes a no-op — fine over SSH, where there's no clipboard anyway). The
graphical app cannot be made fully static: it fundamentally needs the host's graphics
drivers, which can't be bundled into a portable file.

If the build complains about missing system libraries, install the dev headers:

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

### Windows

```powershell
cargo build --release
.\target\release\vaultis-gui.exe        # the graphical app — no console window
.\target\release\vaultis.exe --help     # the command-line version
```

The build produces **two `.exe` files**:

- **`vaultis-gui.exe`** — the graphical app, built as a Windows *GUI-subsystem*
  program so launching it opens **only** the window, with no command/console window
  beside it. **This is the one to hand to a non-technical user** (along with the
  "Edit shortcut" steps in Part 1).
- **`vaultis.exe`** — the *console* version, for the advanced command-line tools
  (`decrypt`, `extract`, `compact`, …) and the `--tui` terminal UI, which need a
  console to show their output.

Each is a **single self-contained file** (the C runtime is linked statically via
`.cargo/config.toml`). Copy them to any **Windows 10 or 11 (x64)** machine and they
run with nothing to install.

> Why two files? A Windows executable is fixed at build time as either a console or
> a GUI program; one file can't be both. So, exactly like Python ships `python.exe`
> (console) and `pythonw.exe` (windowed), vaultis ships a console and a windowed
> build. (The crate forbids `unsafe` code, which rules out the alternative of one
> executable that attaches/detaches a console at runtime.)

#### Build **and** get a demo vault to click around in (Windows)

```bat
scripts\build.bat              :: debug build   (add --release for the optimized one)
```

The Windows twin of `scripts/build.sh` — same flags, same defaults, same demo
passwords. It builds, creates a **fully populated sample vault** if one isn't there
yet, and prints its location and the two passwords (`sample1` / `sample2`) as the last
thing after the build output. `--fresh` rebuilds it, `--sample-dir DIR` puts it
elsewhere, `--no-sample` skips it, and anything after a bare `--` is passed to
`cargo build`. Run `scripts\build.bat --help` for the list.

Everything in that vault is fiction and its passwords are deliberately trivial — never
put anything real in it.

### Cross-compiling a Windows `.exe` from Linux (optional)

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu      # one-time
sudo apt install mingw-w64                    # one-time: the cross-linker + dlltool
# `+crt-static` folds the MinGW runtime (libgcc/libwinpthread) INTO the .exe, so you
# don't have to ship those DLLs beside it:

(Building **on Windows** with the default MSVC toolchain is simpler and already
produces single self-contained `.exe`s — `crt-static` is preset in `.cargo/config.toml`.
Use the GNU cross-build only when you must produce a Windows `.exe` from Linux.)

## Command-line options (advanced)

These are commands of the **console** `vaultis` build. For the graphical app, use
**`vaultis-gui`** instead (same as `vaultis [VAULT]`, but with no console window on
Windows); the `--tui` terminal UI and the subcommands below need the console build.

```text
vaultis [VAULT]              Launch the graphical UI (READ-ONLY; or use vaultis-gui)
vaultis --write [VAULT]      Launch in edit mode (create / edit / delete / upload)
vaultis --tui [VAULT]        Launch the terminal UI instead (add --write to edit)
vaultis --vol PATH ...       Use PATH as the document archive instead of <VAULT>.vol
vaultis decrypt [VAULT]      Decrypt the vault and print its JSON to stdout
vaultis extract [VAULT] DIR  Decrypt all stored documents into DIR
vaultis backup [VAULT] DIR   Copy the encrypted vault + archive into DIR (timestamped)
vaultis compact [VAULT] ...  Reclaim space: re-pack documents and/or trim history
vaultis --help               Show help
```

- **Read-only by default.** The UI opens read-only; pass **`--write`** to enable
  creating, editing, deleting, uploading documents, and changing the master
  passwords. A read-only session writes **nothing** to disk. The window shows a
  `🔒 READ-ONLY` badge and hides write controls when not in edit mode.
- Pass a path to use a specific file: `vaultis ./work-vault.pmv`.
- **Launching from a folder of vaults** (`cd /my/vaults && vaultis`) uses that folder as
  the start page's **Vault root**, ahead of the remembered root and the per-user default.
  It applies only when the folder actually holds vaults — i.e. at least one sub-folder
  with a `vault.pmv` in it, the same test the dropdown uses. An explicit `[VAULT]`
  argument still wins over it.
- **`--vol PATH`** relocates the encrypted document archive (default
  `<VAULT>.vol`, kept beside the vault) — e.g. onto a removable drive:
  `vaultis --write --vol /mnt/usb/docs.vol`. Works with the UI, `extract`, and
  `backup`. The archive is cryptographically bound to its vault, so a mismatched
  `.vol` is rejected.

### Decrypting / extracting at the command line

`decrypt` prints the whole vault as JSON (all secrets in plaintext — handle with
care); `extract` writes decrypted copies of all stored documents into a folder.
Both prompt for the two passwords and never modify the vault.

```bash
vaultis decrypt ./vault.pmv > backup.json        # interactive prompts
printf 'pw1\npw2\n' | vaultis decrypt ./vault.pmv # scripted (passwords via stdin)
vaultis extract ./vault.pmv ./out                 # documents -> ./out/...
```

### Compacting (reclaim space)

Editing and deleting leave behind dead data in the document store, and every entry
keeps a growing edit-history log. `compact` reclaims either or both. It opens in
**edit mode** and is **irreversible**, so by default it makes a dated backup of the
encrypted vault **before** it starts. It is crash-safe (a power loss leaves either
the old or the compacted vault, never a mix).

```bash
vaultis compact ./myvault --volume                       # drop dead document data
vaultis compact ./myvault --json --history-all           # remove all edit history
vaultis compact ./myvault --json --history-before 2025-01-01  # keep history on/after that date
vaultis compact ./myvault --volume --json --history-all  # both at once
vaultis compact ./myvault --volume --dry-run             # just report what it would free
```

- **`--volume`** re-packs the document store, removing the dead blocks left by edits
  and deletes (documents may end up in fewer partitions; this is invisible to your
  entries). **`--json`** trims each entry's edit-history: `--history-all` removes it
  all, or `--history-before YYYY-MM-DD` keeps entries on/after that UTC date. The
  vault-wide audit log is always kept, and a `compacted` event is recorded in it.
- **`--dry-run`** reports what would be reclaimed without changing anything.
  **`--backup DEST`** chooses where the pre-compaction backup goes (must be outside
  the vault folder); **`--no-backup`** skips it. Prompts for the two passwords.

### Terminal (`--tui`) key bindings

**Unlock / Create:** `Tab`/`↑/↓` move between the **Vault root** field, the **Vault**
row, and the two passwords · type to edit the root, or to type/extend the vault name ·
on the Vault row, `←/→` cycle through the vaults found one level under the root · `Enter`
next/submit · `Esc` quit. The open target is `<root>/<vault>`; an existing one is
**Unlock**, a new name is **Create** (needs `--write`).

**Browse:** `←/→` or `1`–`8` switch tab · `↑/↓` select · `Enter` edit · `n` new ·
`d` delete · `t`/`s`/`o`/`v` Account filters (type/subtype/owner/review) ·
`c` Config · `p` change passwords · `q` quit.

**Edit:** `Tab`/`↑`/`↓` move between fields · `←/→` cycle a dropdown · `Ctrl+S`
save · `Ctrl+G` generate password · `Ctrl+R` reveal · `Ctrl+Y` copy (auto-clears
after 15s and on exit) · `Ctrl+U` upload document · `Ctrl+E` export document (to the
**Export directory** set in Config) · `Ctrl+K` detach document · `Esc` cancel.

**Config (`c`):** `Tab`/`↑/↓` move between fields · type to edit · `Enter` apply
(add a type/subtype, set the volume size or redundancy, run a backup, or set the
**Export directory**) · `Del` delete the focused type/subtype (if unused) · `Esc`
back. The **Export directory** and **backup** are usable even in read-only mode.

## How it works & security

- **Two passwords** are combined with a chained **Argon2id** key derivation;
  data is encrypted with **XChaCha20-Poly1305**. The whole file header (including
  the parameters, salt, and nonce) is authenticated, so it can't be tampered with
  undetected.
- The category dropdown lists are stored **inside the encrypted vault** — there
  are no external configuration files.
- Saves are **atomic** (write to a temp file, fsync, rename, fsync the
  directory), so an interrupted write cannot corrupt an existing vault or archive.
  A document append is fsync'd before its manifest is atomically committed, so a
  crash recovers to the last fully-committed state, losing at most the one
  in-flight operation.
- **Corruption fails closed, never silent.** Every read — the vault file, each
  document index (manifest), and each document — is authenticated, so damage,
  tampering, or a wrong password all surface as an explicit error, never as
  wrong/garbled data. A lost or damaged manifest is **rebuilt** by scanning the
  self-describing volume; a damaged main vault file has no in-place spare and is
  recovered from a backup. The recovery scanner is fully bounds-checked, so even a
  maliciously-corrupt volume can't crash it. See `docs/DESIGN.md` §12 (crash-safety)
  and §12.7 (corruption taxonomy & recovery).
- No `unsafe` code; the encryption key is locked out of swap; secrets are wiped
  from memory on close.

[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md); for how the code is organized, see
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md); for the adversarial security

## Mobile apps (Android & iOS)

There are now native **Android** and **iOS** apps, built as one **Compose
Multiplatform** (Kotlin) UI on top of the *same audited Rust core* — no crypto or
storage logic is reimplemented. The repo is a Cargo workspace:

- `crates/vaultis-core` — the headless, audited vault (crypto + storage + records
  + `OpenVault`), reused by every front-end; `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- `crates/vaultis-desktop` — the desktop CLI/TUI/GUI binaries (`vaultis`,
  `vaultis-gui`) — unchanged behaviour.
- `crates/vaultis-ffi` — a thin [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/)
  wrapper the mobile apps call through ([Gobley](https://gobley.dev) generates the
  Kotlin bindings).
- `mobile/` — the Compose Multiplatform Gradle project.

v1 of the apps is a **read-only viewer** (unlock → browse the records → view an
entry → reveal/copy a password). It currently surfaces the first five record types
(Instructions, Trust & Will, Assets, Accounts, Real Estate); the Taxes tab is
desktop-only for now. Copied passwords are auto-cleared from the clipboard after
15 s and immediately on lock. Build/usage details, the offline import model, and the
disclosed mobile security trade-offs are in
[`mobile/README.md`](mobile/README.md). Android builds on Linux/macOS/Windows;
iOS requires a Mac with Xcode.

## Development

```bash
cargo test                              # unit + integration + property tests
cargo test --features fault-injection   # + crash / full-disk recovery tests
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # lints
cargo audit                             # dependency vulnerability scan
cargo +nightly fuzz run parse_frame     # fuzz a parser (parse_header/_manifest/scan_volume)
sudo tests/dmflakey_powerloss.sh        # real power-loss test (see below)
```

**How crash-safety is tested.** Saves are atomic and fsync-ordered, and that is
verified at four levels (`docs/DESIGN.md` §12.5): exact-on-disk-state tests,
in-process full-disk (`ENOSPC`) injection, subprocess **force-kill** at every commit
point (`tests/crash_recovery.rs`), and a real **power-loss** harness
(`tests/dmflakey_powerloss.sh`). The last one is the deepest: the force-kill tests
only kill the *process* (the OS still flushes its cache, so a missing `fsync` would
go unnoticed), whereas the power-loss harness runs the vault on a Linux `dm-flakey`
device and simulates a power cut that **discards every write the program did not
`fsync`** — then asserts the vault still opens with its data intact. It needs root
(it sets up a loop + device-mapper device under unique, auto-cleaned names) and is
not part of `cargo test`; run it manually with `sudo tests/dmflakey_powerloss.sh`.

Property-based (`proptest`) and `cargo-fuzz` targets additionally hammer the parsers,
the redundancy-ring invariants, the calendar math, and the password generator.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the whole suite on every
push and pull request — clippy (warnings denied), the default and `--features
fault-injection` test passes, `cargo audit`, a Windows cross-compile check, and a short
parser fuzz smoke — so the hardening can't silently regress.
